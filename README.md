<h2>Hi I'm Ryan!</h2>

I'm really interested in the flexibility code offers in general, and how it can be used to problem solve! My hobbies with programming include trying to make @nexaitch proud of me and experimenting with esoteric languages! I guess at this point I like algorithms too especially since I'd be taking a masters program on it.
